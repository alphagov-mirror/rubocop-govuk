# While using has_many/through does have some advantages,
# it also requires a significant amount of boilerplate code:
#
# - An additional 'has_many :join_table' statement
# - An additional class for the join table (model)
#
# This Cop/rule appears to have been written with the
# assumption that all join tables have inherent meaning,
# we want to represent, which is not the case; sometimes
# relationships are just # many-to-many, and that's it.
